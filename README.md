This is the list of lawsuits I have titled [List of Web-Accessibility related litigation and settlements](http://www.karlgroves.com/2011/11/15/list-of-web-accessibility-related-litigation-and-settlements/).

As of right now it is grossly out of date as it hasn't been updated in 3 years.

Contributions are needed to bring this list up to date. Feel free to update and issue PRs.
